# Problem Analysis

### Background
Splendor is a popular board game that involves collecting gem tokens and using them to purchase development cards, which in turn help acquire nobles and earn points. Each player takes turns to perform actions such as collecting gem tokens, reserving cards, or purchasing development cards. The game ends when a player reaches 15 points, and the player with the most points wins.

### Problem
Agents must manage limited resources, plan for both short-term and long-term goals, and anticipate the actions of their opponents. It needs to make an action in one second to achieve the strategy such as accumulating the right combination of gem tokens to buy valuable development cards; planning for future turns by anticipating which cards will be needed to attract nobles; reacting to the opponent's actions by adjusting strategies to prevent them from gaining an advantage.

### Project Goal
The objective of this project is to implement an AI agent capable of playing Splendor using different AI techniques. By exploring methods such as MinMax, A*, and Q-learning, we aim to evaluate their performance, strengths, and weaknesses in the context of this complex strategic game.
